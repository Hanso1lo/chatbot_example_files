# chatbot_example_files

This repsoitory contains the "configuration" files for 3 different chatbots we have been working on 

## 1 Chatbot based on NLTK

The related configuration file is 1_pairs.txt. The file defines how the chatbot is acting. The setup is very basic and revolves around some general topics (see pairs.txt for detail). Based on the NLTK package the chatbot can recognize some basic intents like greetings etc.

## 2 Chatbot using NLTK and Pytorch

## 3 Chatbot using the RASA package. 

Has 3 "configuration files". The RASA package offers a higher level way to program chatbots. There is very little "programming" involved as most of the details are run in a black box manner by the package (i.e. it is not clear from the start what sort of networ is operating in the background and so forth.
